With so much time spent on thinking about what to eat each day, our team has come up with a solution to help you pick your next meal within a 5 minute moment based on two sources of information, your background information collected at the sign up process and your feelings right now on what you crave. The project is still a working demo and missing an algorithm to predict / which is the most important part of the project. We plan, in the future, to develop a working prototype of machine learning models either through collaborative filtering (item or use based) to help with prediction for customers.

## Purpose 
This prototype was for 2022's Magic Box Solution Hackathon and this project scored 4th place, 1 point away from that 40k. Yes, we know, that is incredibily sad and it keeps ME awake every single night. 

## Name
The project is tittled 'Gin Arai Dee' which means 'What shall we eat in Thai!"

## Project status
The development of this project has stopped completely. The front end is not as well designed as it should be and you are feel free to fork this and develop a working app based on our idea.
